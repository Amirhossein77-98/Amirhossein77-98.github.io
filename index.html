        <p>
            I'm Amir and I have to introduce myself to you ðŸ˜Š.  My full name is Amirhossein Gholizadeh and I'm from Iran.
            I think I should say as an Iranian I have no special hobbies because every enjoyment is "haram" here. But thanks God, there is still coding avalible to do ðŸ¤©.
            <!-- <p>
                If you'r curious about how I found that I love coding, I should say accidentally! When I was about 14 or 15 I had a "weblog" and for that weblog I had to choose
                templates. But none of them were the one that I wanted, there was a part in each of them that I liked so I decided to understand how they are built so that I could
                modify them!
            </p> -->
            <p>
                For now I'm learning how to code persistantly and non-stop. I started With Python, and I'm continueing with Javascript. Besides I'm learning HTML and CSS too.
                 I'm looking forward to become a Full-stack developer. But I love machine Learning and AI too, God help me with that ðŸ¥².
            </p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 10px;">We live in codes!</h2>
            <p style="margin: 0;">
                Codes define everything. From genetics, to organisms, humans, and computers, all work with codes.
                We think? we code it on our nurons! We eat? that's a function that gets called whenever our cells need energy!
                We decide? that's a conditional statement that we evaluated! And etc...
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 0;">
                And I love coding because they create everything, codes design everything, this is codes and how they get interpreted that
                causes into the different sights between creatures. It is code that makes something live! Without codes, everything just exists, nothing lives!
